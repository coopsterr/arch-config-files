# arch-config-files
all of the conifg files that I edited/made while using arch Arch linux and Qtile.
If I have broken any copyright rules and you want this taken down please just contact me I do not mind at all.
I have uploaded these primarily for personal use, as it is a backup and means I can copy and share these key files every time I distro hop, But also to serve as an example for other people who are using the same programs, as I always found it helpful to have examples of peoples config files while I was editing mine.

still a work in progress.
